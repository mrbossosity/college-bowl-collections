A thiamine deficiency can cause an excess of ammonia to be produced as a result of the metabolism of this compound, of which wbuZ is a side product and urocanic acid is a main product. The Ames test is used to detect disruption of the synthesis of this molecule, which, along with beta-alanine, is a component of the dipeptide carnosine.
