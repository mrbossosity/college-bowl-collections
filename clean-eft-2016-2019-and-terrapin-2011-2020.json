    "formatted_text": "<b>This government briefly and disastrously put its army quartermasters in charge of all transportation logistics, leading to a horrifying incident in which 61 prisoners suffocated when troops lost track of them after locking them in a freight transport. An early test for this government was the Orissa famine, while an early death knell for this state was the failure of the Cripps mission. This state responded to the tepid reception of its (*)</b>) Montagu-Chelmsford reforms by cracking down through the Rowlatt Acts, and was plagued by the long-running Moplah unrest. Reginald Dyer, a commander for this state, went absolutely insane and turned his car-mounted machine guns on a crowd of festival-goers in a 1919 massacre, while a caravan of protesters arrived at Dandi and began making salt to protest this government's taxes.

    "formatted_text": "<b>One theory about how these structures evolved posits that they originally were used by the cell to break down the compound they now synthesize. Its action was observed in an experiment in which a fluorescent filament of actin was attached to its gamma subunit and turned counterclockwise in the presence of a certain molecule. The F0 complex of this protein forms a channel through the membrane, whereas the F1 complex stretches into the matrix. The binding of a proton to one of the c-subunits in the (*)</b>) F0 produces a 1/10 turn in the gamma subunit of this protein, in turn driving a conformational change in the alpha-beta subunit which allows for the binding of the namesake molecule.
